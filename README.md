# Ponish Mechanised

This project is dedicated to making it easier to learn and practice the shortand system described in
["My Little Ponish, Theory and Practice" manual](https://www.deviantart.com/poisonhorsie/art/My-Little-Ponish-Theory-and-Practice-800852076).

Specifically, this project encodes Ponish glyphs and rules in Python, and uses
[Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) to simulate writing
Ponish by hand.

## Ponish Manual Mechanised

To ensure consistency with the original manual, everything that was hand written for the
manual has been also written using Turtle Graphics and compiled into
[Ponish Manual Mechanised](./manual/index.md) .

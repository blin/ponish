# Part One: the Lessons

Have you ever noticed that the written words seen on the show My Little Pony
resemble standard English orthography but aren't quite the same? Almost like
they've been smashed together, and piled higgledy-piggledy atop one another?
Have you ever wondered why? Wonder no more! Within the pages of this document I
will bequeath to thee the secrets of modern Ponish, and in so doing give you a
marvelous way to write more quickly, and succinctly; the better for taking notes
in meetings, or classes where time, and writing space may be scarce. This is
especially important if you are a pony; mouthwriting is hard, and the less you
can get away with writing while still saying what you mean to say, the better!

Ponish is taught to young fillies, and colts in stages, and so shall it be to
you. If you persevere to the end you'll get the full benefits of speed, and
brevity inherent in the system, roughly 3 times as fast, in 1/3 the space, if
you get good at it. But even if you stop after the first lesson, you shall have
a method with which to write a little bit faster than otherwise, and perhaps to
keep your pesky room-mates from reading your plans to conquer the world. Unlike
many systems of shorthand, with Ponish, you can choose your own level of
functionality!

Are you ready? Of course you are!
